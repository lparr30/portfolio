            <p>I can be described as vivacious, hard working, some might go so far as to say I'm extraordinarily funny. But let me paint a more colorful picture for you:</p>
            <p>The meat and potatoes: I went to school for Mechanical Engineering (University of Maryland, go Terps!) and shortly after graduating I shifted to teaching.</p>
            <p>Using my people skills and burning love for math, I had the opportunity to teach some seriously amazing (and absolutely hysterical) kids.</p>
            <p>Cue: web development. I enrolled in a fullstack web dev boot camp as a way to fulfill what had always felt like a long-shot goal of being a developer. Being a self-starter is something I take pride in. With a mountain of obstacles in my way, I've been able to achieve my goals by doing one thing at a time, with integrity and some elbow grease. The metaphorical kind - I'm also quite particular about my workspace being clean.</p>
            
            <p>Stepping off my soap box: I want to create captivating products with a team of talented and likeminded professionals. Take a look at my projects and connect with me via the links below!</p>
